    <h1>Homepage</h1>

    <p>Welcome to my exciting homepage</p>

    <!-- put what your website is all about just below here -->

    <p>This website is all about putting together how to build a website in an easy way, and provide links to some resources such as <a href="https://github.com/mercadofred/mercadofred.github.io"> GitHub</a> which provides free website hosting services</p> 

    <p>The <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/"> Markdown Cheat Sheet, </a>part of the Markdown Guide is a free and open-source reference guide that explains how to use Markdown, the simple and easy-to-use markup language you can use to format virtually any document. Markdown can be used instead of HTML to create websites.</p>

    <p>To be clear, we won't be using Markdown as such to create web content, but instead will use the Markdown Cheat Sheet as a reference to the HTML commands one can use to build webpages.</p>

    <p>Lets start by showing you the <a href="social.html"> HTML file used to create this webpage</a>  you are looking at right now.</p>
